Project 2 - Machine learning

subset of AI
lots of applications
build a model/engine and give it lots of data
the model will find and learn patterns in the input data
apply on new data
the more input data => the more accurate model

Steps:
1. Import data
2. Clean data (duplicates, irrelevant, incomplete, right data type, etc.)
3. Split the data into Training/Test Sets (80/20)
4. Create a model (algorithm depends on problem to solve)
5. Train the model
6. Make predictions
7. Evaluate (measure accuracy) and Improve

Libraries:
Numpy - provides a multidimensional array
Pandas - data analysis, provide data frame (two dimensional data structure ~ spreadsheet) 
MatPlotLib - two dimensional plotting library for creating graphs on plots
Scikit-Learn - provides common algorithms (decision tree, neural networks etc.)

for machine learning Jupyter is used to write code
